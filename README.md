# Writing-Clean-Python-Code
This is the code repository for [Python Clean Coding [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/in/programming/python-clean-coding-video	), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way.
Peter Fisher will teach you Python features that are applicable to writing clean code. First, we will talk about the pros and cons that confront the programmer when trying to write clean Python code. Then, we will explore the structure of a Python program and highlight features that will help us clean up and simplify our code. We will explore some good editors with built-in code analysis and linters to help guide you. We will also talk about some very helpful modules that will keep your code clean and prevent you from reinventing the wheel. Then, we will discuss some general code cleaning guidelines that aren’t exclusively applicable to Python, including naming conventions and programming styles.
Finally, we will apply what we’ve learned in the previous videos to rewriting and reorganizing real-world Python programs into clean and beautiful code that can be more easily understood, debugged, and extended.
